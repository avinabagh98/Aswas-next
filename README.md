# Process Breakdown for "Yes" Button Click Event

## Radio Button Click Event:

- When the "Yes" radio button is clicked, it triggers the `onChange` event handler attached to the input element.

## `handleRadioChange_color` Function:

- The `handleRadioChange_color` function is called, typically passed as a prop to the Surveyoption component.
- It receives the id of the question associated with the radio button and the value "yes".
- The function updates the state (`selectedOption`) with the new value for the specified id using the functional form of `setState`.
  - For example, if the id is "field_2_form_5" and the value is "yes", the state will be updated to `{ ...prevState, field_2_form_5: "yes" }`.

## State Update:

- After the state is updated, React re-renders the component.
- The Surveyoption component receives the updated `radioValue` prop, representing the selected option for that question.

## Conditional Rendering of CSS Classes:

- Based on the updated `radioValue`, the appropriate CSS class (`labelYes` or `label_not_selected`) is applied to the "Yes" label.
  - If the value of `radioValue` is "yes", the `labelYes` class is applied, changing the color of the "Yes" label to green.
  - If the value of `radioValue` is not "yes", the `label_not_selected` class is applied, which might have a default color defined.

## UI Update:

- As a result of the state update and conditional rendering of CSS classes, the UI reflects the changes. 
- The "Yes" label will appear green, indicating that it has been selected.

In summary, when the "Yes" button is clicked, the `handleRadioChange_color` function is called to update the state with the new value. After the state is updated, the UI re-renders, applying the appropriate CSS class to reflect the selected option's color change.
